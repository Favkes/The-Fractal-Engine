# About:

###

The Fractal Engine is a miniature project aiming at compact and efficient rendering
of fractals on any machine supporting numpy. <br>
By using numpy's efficient mutidimensional array arithmetic support,
it allows for over 1.4 Megapixel/s rendering speed, achieving much stabler computing times 
than methods focusing on individual pixel calculations.
